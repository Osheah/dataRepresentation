Exercies for GMIT Data Representation 2019
### exercise 1.1 in books.xml
Create an XML file that stores data for a library. 
The library has two catalogues (technical books, and for cookery books).
Each catalogue can contain a number of books (say 2 for the purpose of this exercise) . 
Books will have an ISBN, title and author.

- week03-webScraping - PY01-* to PY06-*
- week04-JSON-REST - Lab01, Lab2, Lab03 and Lab04
- week05 - testcreate.html, testdelete.html, testgetall.html, testupdate.html

some of the challange labs have been attempted but I'm having some issues.
